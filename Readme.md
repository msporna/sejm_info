what is this?

The sejm_info repository presents an innovative tool designed to streamline the analysis of legal act projects from the Polish parliament (Sejm). Utilizing the power of OpenAI's ChatGPT API coupled with Python, this toolkit offers a robust platform for automatically downloading, summarizing, and interpreting legislative documents. By leveraging natural language processing, sejm_info transforms complex legal texts into concise summaries, facilitating a clearer understanding of legislative intent and nuances.

This project aims to provide researchers, legal professionals, and interested citizens with a user-friendly interface to explore and analyze legislative proposals efficiently. Whether for academic research, professional review, or public awareness, sejm_info serves as your go-to resource for digesting the intricacies of Polish legislative works through the lens of AI.
